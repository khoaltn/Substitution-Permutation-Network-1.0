 * Instruction: Compile the source code by typing in the terminal:
 *                     $ g++ -std=c++11 -o SPN SPN.cpp testSPN.cpp
 *              To run the binary file, type:
 *                     $ ./SPN
Follow the documentation and example usage in testSPN.cpp on how to use the SPN class. 

Future Improvements:
- More secure key schedule, S-boxes, and permutation tables.
- More efficient implementation of calculations.
